TRACKSTORER

TrackStorer is a little app that I created ages ago to more easily transfer MP3 music files from iTunes to my 3rd-party MP3 player that can be mounted as USB storage.


IMPORTANT!

You *must* check out UliKit into a folder next to this one, or it will not find some needed files.


FAQ

Q: Does TrackStorer support my MP3 player that doesn't have Mac drivers?
A: No. TrackStorer is simply a file copying tool. Your driver must mount as a valid volume on your Mac, and you must be able to copy music files to it manually using Finder.

Q: Can you add support for my MP3 player to TrackStorer?
A: You have the source code. Edit the Players.plist to add the specifics of your MP3 player

Q: Where can I get support for TrackStorer?
A: Nowhere. TrackStorer is provided "as is". If it works for you, fine. If it doesn't, tough luck. I'm making this code available because I keep getting asked.

Q: Will you update TrackStorer to work with the new library format in current iTunes releases?
A: Probably not. But you have the source code. Fix it and send me a pull request.
